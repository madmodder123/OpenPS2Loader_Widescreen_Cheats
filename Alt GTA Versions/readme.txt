The games Grand Theft Auto Vice City and GTA San Andreas both have multiple versions and the cheat files included in the 
OPL/CHT folder does not work with all of them them. I have included alternate widescreen cheats in this folder in case the default does not work.

If the default widescreen cheat is not working (i.e. it is cropping the image from unpatched 4:3 as opposed to expanding it)
then you can simply copy the cheat file from the folder corresponding to your version of the game to the OPL/CHT file, replacing
the default cheat file. Also note that that these patches also increase the FOV for the game in 4:3, so you'll need to compare
the game with cheats to the game without cheats in order to determine if the cheat is actually working. You also still need to enable the in-game
widescreen option in order for these cheats to work. 

In my opinion, the best way to test if your cheat file is working is to run the game without cheats in widescreen mode and then run the game with cheats,
also in widescreen mode. You'll notice right away that the cheats are working if the camera is more zoomed out to the point where your character's feet
are visible.

To determine your version of Vice City, you can look at the barcode on the game's case. The first set of numbers on the barcode is always "10425"
The second set of numbers varies by version:

v 1.40 - 27145
v 2.01 - 27300
v 3.00 - 21383 OR 27388

San Andreas has two versions. v 1.03 and v 3.00. v 3.00 says "SECOND EDITION" on the disc.

If you don't have physical copies of the games you can always just test using the method described above.
